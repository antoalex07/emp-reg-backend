This is a backend for an Employee Register application made using Spring Boot. To create this application you have to go to start.spring.io and select the necessary version for java and spring boot maven or gradle, I chose maven for the project and then whether its jar or war and then we can choose which all dependencies we want for the website. I have taken Spring Web, Lombok, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, Spring Starter Validation, Spring Data MongoDB, Spring Boot Devtools. Each of the dependencies here serve a vital part in the code. Then we can generate the code and download it into the system and work on it in Intellij IDEA
